## Configuring the antiraid system

### Preventing mass joins

This module will trigger when the number of accounts joining the server exceeds the threshold within a short time frame.

<Warning>
  Whenever the threshold is reached, the server will be placed in a raid state.
  This will temporarily disable intensive events which bleed dispatches, such as
  **welcome** and **goodbye** messages.
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,antiraid massjoin (on or off) [--threshold (number)] [--do (action)] [--lock (true | false)] [--punish (true | false)]

```javascript Example
,antiraid massjoin on --threshold 5 --do ban --lock true --punish true
```

## What to do after a raid

<Steps>
    <Step title="Cleaning up">
        After a raid, it's recommended to clean up the server by removing all the accounts that joined during the raid, you can do this with the `recentban` and `raid` commands.

        <Info>
        The `duration` parameter must use the proper format, you can learn more
        [here](/resources/syntax#formatting-a-duration).
        </Info>
        <CodeGroup>
        ```javascript Syntax
        ,recentban (amount) <reason>
        ,raid (duration) (kick or ban) <reason>
        ```

        ```javascript Example
        ,recentban 50 // Bans the last 50 accounts that joined the server
        ,raid 2h ban // Bans all accounts that joined the server in the last 2 hours
        ```
        </CodeGroup>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Disabling the raid state">
        After the raid is over, you can disable the raid state with the `antiraid state` command, this will re-enable events, unlock channels, and allow accounts to join the server.
    </Step>

</Steps>
