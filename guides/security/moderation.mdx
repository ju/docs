title: 'Moderation'
description: "As soon as you invite the bot to a server that its never been in before, you'll want to set up moderation commands and moderation logs with the commands below."
---

```
,setup - Configures jail and mod logs
,setupmute - Configures necessary mute roles
```
You should then see that bleed has created two channels, as shown below. The **jail-log** channel is where all the logs for moderation command usage goes, and the **jail** channel is where jailed users are restricted to.

Additionally, Bleed will have created 3 roles for muting of members, as seen below.

### What do all these roles do?
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Jail">
    Restricts a member to being only able to see your jail channel that you setup earlier. Make sure to run `,settings jailroles true` in order to make bleed remove a users roles upon jailing them.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Muted">
  Removes a member's permission to talk in channels via the addition of a role with that permission denied.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Image Muted">
    Removes a member's permission to attach files and embed links in channels via the addition of a role with that permission denied.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reaction Muted">
