title: 'Antiraid'
description: 'Antiraid is used to prevent the joining of automated accounts into your server which are often used maliciously. Antiraid has 3 modules as detailed below.'
---

## Antiraid Massjoin.
Antiraid Massjoin triggers when five (or more, depending on your threshold) members join a server within 1.61 seconds. From then on, all suspected raid accounts will be punished with the punishment you have set.

This command takes both the ``--threshold`` parameter, to define how many accounts it takes to trigger the antiraid; and the ``--do`` parameter to determine the punishment.
### Example:
```
,antiraid massjoin on
,antiraid massjoin on --threshold 4
,antiraid massjoin on --threshold 4 --do kick
```
## Antiraid Defaultpfp
This module punishes users that use discord's deafult pfp. This is useful as a lot of automated raid accounts do not have a pdp set. 

This command only takes the `--do` parameter for the punishment.
### Example:
```
,antiraid defaultpfp on
,antiraid defaultpfp on --do kick
```
## Antiraid Newaccounts.
This module punishes users that have a new discord account. A lot of raid accounts are freshly created, and this is an effective way at stopping them.  

This command takes both the ``--threshold`` parameter, to define how many days young the account has to be to trigger; and the ``--do`` parameter to determine the punishment.
### Example:
```
,antiraid newaccounts on
,antiraid newaccounts on --threshold 4
,antiraid newaccounts on --threshold 4 --do kick
```

## I've been raided, what now?
- If you didn't have bleed's protections enabled - enable them. You can remove the raid accounts from your server with the `,raid` command, which has the syntax `,raid (time) (kick or ban) (reason)` - for example `,raid 5m ban Suspected raid`.

- If you did have protections enabled, then congratulations - your server is safe. Once you have verified that the raid is over run `,antiraid raidstate off` to remove bleed's raid state.
