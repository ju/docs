## What are the benefits of fakepermissions?

Fakepermissions restrict your moderators and administrators access to native discord permissions, such as `ban_members` or `manage_channels`. This means that, for example, even though the `ban_members` discord permission is not attached to that role, they can still use the `,ban` command within bleed.

This negates the possibility of a rougue administrator or moderator using a script that spams the discord API and mass bans all members or deletes all channels as they don't have that permission - it makes nuking practically impossible. 

## How to manage a role's fakepermissions.
<Info>You must be the **server owner** to run these commands.</Info>

,fakepermissions grant (role mention or id) ban_members

,fakepermissions grant @Moderator ban_members
