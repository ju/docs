description: "Fake permissions allow you to restrict a moderators native role permissions and making a nuke impossible by forcing usage of bleed's moderation commands."

## What are the benefits of fake permissions?

Fake permissions restrict your moderators and administrators access to native discord permissions, such as `ban_members` or `manage_channels`. This means that, for example, even though the `ban_members` discord permission is not attached to that role, they can still use the `,ban` command within bleed.

This negates the possibility of a rogue administrator or moderator using a script that spams the Discord API and mass bans all members or deletes all channels as they don't have that permission - it makes nuking practically impossible. 

## How to manage a role's fake permissions.
<Info>You must be the **server owner** to run these commands. - a full list of supported permissions can be found [here](/extras/fplist).</Info>

```
// syntax
,fakepermissions grant (role mention or id) ban_members
// example
,fakepermissions grant @Moderator ban_members
```
```
// syntax
,fakepermissions remove (role mention or id) ban_members
// example
,fakepermissions remove @Moderator ban_members
```
