## About
[Disboard](https://disboard.org/) is a server list service that is commonly used to promote servers. To ensure that your server is getting the most visibility, you can use the disboard bot to "bump" your server on their website to get more engagement. Bleed's integration allows users to be reminded when it is time to run the `/bump` command.
