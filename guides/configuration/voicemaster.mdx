## Initial Setup
<Steps>
  <Step title="Run the setup command.">
    The first thing you should do is run `,vm setup`.
    
     This command will create a new category with two new channels, an `interface` text channel, which contains VC controls for users, and a `Join to Create` voice channel, which is used to create temporary VCs upon joining. 
  </Step>

</Steps>

## Customization
<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="voicemaster category">
        Changes the default category newly created VCs are sent to. The deafult is the same category as the `Join to Create` VC. 
        ```
        ,voicemaster category <category ID>
        ```
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="voicemaster defaultbitrate">
        Set the default bit rate of all new voicemaster channels.
        ```
        ,voicemaster deafultbitrate <rate>
        ```
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="voicemaster default role">
        Set a role that is given when a user joins **any** voicemaster channel and removed when they leave.
        ```
        ,voicemaster default role @role
        ```
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="voicemaster defaultname">
        Sets the default name of all newly created voicemaster channels.
        ```
        Example:
        ,voicemaster defaultname {user.mention}'s custom vc
        ```
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="voicemaster reset">
        Resets all configurations for voicemaster.
        ```
        ,voicemaster reset
        ```
        <Warning>This will delete all channels and categories created by voicemaster. This includes `interface`, `Join to Create`, and the entire voicemaster category. </Warning>
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## VC Control Commmands
All buttons from the `interface` channel also have command variants, found below. All commands below, except `,vm claim`, require you to be the **owner of the VC**.
<Note>Commands with a `*` do not have a button on the interface, and ones with `🏅` require an active [**Tier 2** subscription](https://i-got-racks-bottega.bleed.bot/perks).</Note>
