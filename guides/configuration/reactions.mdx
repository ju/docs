## Reaction triggers

You can add reaction triggers with the `,reactiontrigger add` command - or `,rt add` for simplicity. 
<Info>Note that reaction triggers have to be a minimum of 4 characters, and certain common words like `hi` and `hey` are not allowed to prevent spamming the bot and slowing it down.</Info>

## Reaction messages
You can also setup bleed to react to all messages sent in a channel with `,reaction messages`. You can use up to 3 reactions, and there must be a slowmode of at least **one minute** to prevent spam.
