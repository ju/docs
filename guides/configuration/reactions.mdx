title: 'Reaction Triggers'
description: 'Reaction triggers allow bleed to react to a message when a condition is met, like having a certain word in a message.'

## Setup

You can add reaction triggers with the `,reactiontrigger add` command - or `,rt add` for simplicity. 
<Info>Note that reaction triggers have to be a minimum of 4 characters, and certain common words like `hi` and `hey` are not allowed to prevent spamming the bot and slowing it down.</Info>
