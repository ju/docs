### Customization Options

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Custom Messages">
        Add a custom message that is sent to your channel alongside the tweet.
        <Warning> When setting a pingable message with X, it is advised to private the channel when setting up. Bleed will bulk send the first portion of tweets, which can cause people to be pinged repeatedly in a matter of seconds. </Warning>
        <Tip>Supports **raw text** and **embed code**! Add `--pingable on` to ping a role in the message.</Tip>
        ```
        // Command syntax
        x message @handle (message)

        // Raw text example without ping
        x message @handle New post!

        // Embed example with ping
        x message @handle {embed}$v{description: New post!}$v{message:@everyone} --pingable on
        ```
        You can view the message set with `x message view [handle]`
