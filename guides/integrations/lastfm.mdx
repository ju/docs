## About LastFm
Last.fm is a music tracking and statsitics site that watches what you listen to. By users linking their Last.fm accounts with Bleed, users can automatically update their current listening status, showcase their top tracks and artists.

<Warning>
Last.fm accounts that are marked as private will not be able to utilise some of Bleed's commands due to the bot not having access to the data.
</Warning>

# Lastfm Setup
To begin with lastfm, run `,lf login`. Bleed will then direct message you (ensure direct messages are enabled otherwise this wont work) 

Once you have recieved this dm, click "[here](https://last.fm/api/auth/?api_key=b734cbac65e49025a8cdfd16145458fd&cb=https://q2ewba9f8jh8pszy.bleed.bot/lastfm/callback?i=IWpzySR)" on the embed. This will take you to a connect application page on lastfm, simply press "allow access"

Once you have allowed access, you will be taken to bleeds website confirming authorisation, if the website displays there was an error doing this, run `,lf login` again and retrace your steps.

Make sure that your spotify is connected in order for bleed to read what your current playing track is by pressing this button.

Once all of these steps have been completed, your lastfm should be ready to use with bleed once it completes indexing. This will be identifiable when bleed displays this message: 

![Ready to use lastfm module](https://github.com/ju/docs/blob/main/static/lfconfirm.png?raw=true)

To check if everything is working, run `,np` in a channel, bleed should display a nowplaying embed (this will only work aslong as you are currently listening to a song on spotify.)
