## How to obtain Donator Perks
There are 3 tiers of donator perks, all of which are available to purchase through server subscriptions in our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/bleed). Head to the top of the channel list and press the 'shop' button. There are 3 tiers, prices and perks of which will be detailed below. 
<Warning>Users on the discord app on an Apple device will be forced to pay extra due to the App Store payment guidelines. To circumvent this, purchase from Desktop or from logging in via the Safari browser rather than the app.</Warning>
