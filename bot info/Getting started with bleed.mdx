## Setting up the moderation system.
As soon as you invite the bot to a server that it's never been in before, you'll want to set up moderation commands and moderation logs with the commands below.
```
,setme
```
```
,setupmute
```
You should then see that Bleed has created 2 channels, as shown below. The jail-log channel is where all the logs for moderation command usage goes, and the jail channel is where jailed users are restricted to.
